# OpenLSTO
**Open Source Code for Level Set Topology Optimization**

OpenLSTO is an open-source software for level set based structural topology optimization, written in C++, developed and Maintained by researchers at UC San Diego and Cardiff University.

The topology optimization method deals with the problem of determining the optimal distribution inside a design domain in order to obtain the best structural performance. Level Set Method was originally developed as a mathematical tool for tracking the motion of interfaces. Its natural handling of topological changes coupled with a clear and smooth interface representation led to its use for structural topology optimization.

This first full release implements the M2DO labâ€™s level set topology optimization method to solve the problems of minimizing compliance (maximizing stiffness) under a volume constraint and minimizing stress under a volume constraint in 2D and 3D design domains. A hole nucleation algorithm for the compliance problem is also included. While OpenLSTO has been designed with ease of installation and use in mind, some third-party packages have been used in order for the code to be able to handle more complex problems. A light version of the code without third-party packages, and with less capabilities, is available [here](https://github.com/M2DOLab/OpenLSTO-lite)

The level-set module of this software, M2DO_LSM, was adapted from code written by [Lester Hedges](https://github.com/lohedges/slsm), which can be found [here](https://github.com/lohedges/slsm).

## Installation
-  Download

To clone the repository to the local machine,(git client) 
```git clone https://github.com/M2DOLab/OpenLSTO.git```

The Zip file is also available with the following static link:
[Download link](http://m2do.ucsd.edu/static/zip/OpenLSTO-v1.0.zip)

- CLI environment

In general, all OpenLSTO execution occurs via command line arguments within a terminal. For Unix/Linux or Mac OS X users, the native terminal applications are needed. 

- Execution

Go to the relevant folder under projects to run a specific module, e.g to compliance minimization:
> cd projects/compliance

Compile & Build: 
> make main

Execution
> ./bin/a.out

Clean existing compilation files:
> make clean

clean existing object files:
> make clean_obj

clean existing output files:
> make clean_results

- External dependency

Users of OpenLSTO need a data visualization tool to post-process solution files. The software currently supports .vtk output format natively read by [*ParaView*](https://www.paraview.org/).
